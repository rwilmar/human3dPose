# Human 3d Pose Estimation
Multipose 3d pose estimation using 2d pose estimation deep learning models in OpenVino

For the field of industrial robot interaction, as a research tool or for simple motion applications thereâ€™s a need for building fast and accurate human pose estimation, either for limiting speed or acceleration in the robot task execution, or for real time job interaction between humans and robots, this work propose to study a moderately easy to use, and fast commissioning 3d human pose detection system using multiple camera images, multiple deep learning models inference in a state of the art joint estimation system.
